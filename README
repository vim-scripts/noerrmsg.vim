This plugin addresses the issue on autocompletion plugins, like YouCompleteMe. From its FAQ:

    I get annoying messages in Vim's status area when I type

    If you're referring to the User defined completion <bla bla> back at original and similar, then sadly there's no fix for those. Vim will emit them no matter how hard I try to silence them.

    You'll have to learn to ignore them. It's a shitty "solution", I know.

With this plugin those messages in the status area are hidden.
